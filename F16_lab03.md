a. A brief description: The fish animation launchs a game in which you can control a shark(or a white whale) with your mouse or arrow key. You want to reach 50 points by eating fishes and avoid jellyfish during this process.

b. User stories:  
... as a player, I can use the mouse to control a shark to eat fish; 
                  as a player, I can choose the difficulty in the menus;
                  as a player, I can pause my game so that I can answer the phont;
                  as a player, I can control the shark to eat fish so that I get game potins.

c. The game fish animation can run and have a simple instruction for player. It has a complete game logic, but the instructions is insufficient.

d. User sotries to make it more fun: as a player, I can choose the game mod, so that I can play either play in sandbox or the normal mod; 
                                      as a player, I can control the shark to swim faster from time to time, so I can avoid the jellyfish.
                                      as a player, I may expect some events that subtract the points so that the game is more challanging.

e. The current README.md is good, it bascilly descibe some issues we can develop to make the project better. Some extra information about the functions of each file may be helpful for the next generation.

f. The cureent targes in buil.xml are run, runEnv, compile, clean, run-from-jar, javadoc. jar and run-from-jar don't have description and runEnv doesn't work. Also, javadoc seems need to be updated to produce a right javadoc.

g. Currently, there are 19 issues. There are enough issues to get me 1000 points. All issues have a pretty clear description.

h. There are enough issues to get me 1000 points, and nothing good has comes to our mind at this point.

i.

j. There's no Junit Tests at current point. The easiest way to test our code may be just run the game and see whether it functions or not.
