F16 final remarks

Currently the game runs, and we have the following classes:
* Game logics: Score, Score Manager, ScoreComparer, ScumOftheSea, JellyFish, Fish, Shark, SoundEffects, Character.
* GUI: Menu, GeneralPathWrapper.
* Mixed: FishAnimationEnvironment.


The main function to start the program is in Menu.java. Menu.java takes care of building the main menu of the game, and some Jbuttons on it are tied to some functions in FishAnimationEnvironment.java, where the bulk of the game is defined. Currently, FishAnimationEnvironemnt.java is a mix of Game Logics and GUI stuffs, so it is pretty hard to read through and understand. A code refactoring on this java file is highly recommanded: try to separate the game logic from GUI. The Score Class implements Serializable so that the scores can be stored and provides that game-stop feature, but it is more usual to record the highscores in a database. It is challanging, but a nice chance to learn how to drive the database inside a Java program using JDBC.
