..* As a fish, I shall be more pretty to attract the shark.
..* As a score board, I will show the scores to win and the scores added per fish eaten.
..* As a shark, I could grow up by eating fish.  

##Question(e)
Basically, the README.md is quite good. It descibes the errors we may encounter in the future. It also includes classes like logics, GUI and mixed. However, becuase it is README file. If it can talk about little about the game itself, it will be better. I want to add brief description and rules.

##Question(f)
Target jar and run-from-jar do not have descriptions right now. There are no old legacy JWS stuff that needs to be removed.

##Question(g)
There are 30 open questions and they are enough for us to earn 1000. Besides, the issues are pretty clear.

##Question(h)
We have not added any new issues yet. We may add in the future.
